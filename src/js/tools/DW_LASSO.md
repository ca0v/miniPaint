-   inject smoothing points into the polygon when "q"
-   center about the current point when "c"
-   prepare to drag this point when "Left+mousedown" or " +Left+mousedown" or "touchmove" (hover -> before_dragging)
-   begin dragging this point when "Left+mousemove" or " +Left+mousemove" or "touchmove" (before_dragging -> dragging)
-   drag this point when "Left+mousemove" or " +Left+mousemove" or "touchmove"

-   automatically create vertices as mouse moves when "Left+mousemove" or " +Left+mousemove" or "touchmove"
-   when moving the mouse, move the last point to the mouse location when "mousemove" (drawing -> placing)
-   place a point at the mouse location behind the drag point when " " or " +Left+mousemove"
-   create the 1st point of the polygon when "Left+mousedown" or "touchstart" (ready -> drawing)
-   continue moving the last point to the mouse location when "mousemove"
-   stop placing and enter drawing mode when "Left+mousedown" (placing -> drawing)
-   close poly when the last is also the first when "mousemove" (placing -> editing)
-   add a point to the polygon when "Left+mousedown" or "touchmove" or "touchstart"
-   zoom in when "+" or "=" or "Shift++" or "Spread"
-   zoom out when "-" or "Shift+\_" or "Pinch"
-   pan left when "DragDragRight" or "Shift+ArrowLeft"

-   pan up when "DragDragDown" or "Shift+ArrowUp"
-   pan down when "DragDragUp" or "Shift+ArrowDown"
-   pan from when "mousemove"
-   pan to when "Shift+mousemove"
-   go to prior vertex when "Shift+Tab" (editing,hover -> editing)
-   go to next vertex when "Tab" (editing,hover -> editing)
-   move the point left when "ArrowLeft"
-   move the point right when "ArrowRight"
-   move the point up when "ArrowUp"
-   move the point down when "ArrowDown"
-   move the point up and left when "Control+ArrowLeft+ArrowUp" or "ArrowLeft+ArrowUp"
-   move the point up and right when "Control+ArrowRight+ArrowUp" or "ArrowRight+ArrowUp"
-   move the point down and left when "Control+ArrowLeft+ArrowDown" or "ArrowLeft+ArrowDown"
-   move the point down and right when "Control+ArrowRight+ArrowDown" or "ArrowRight+ArrowDown"
-   after deleting the last point indicate we are ready for the 1st point when "Delete" or "Backspace" or "Shift+Left+mousedown" (editing -> ready)
-   delete the hover point when "Delete" or "Backspace" or "Shift+Left+mousedown" (editing,hover -> editing)
-   mouse has moved over a point when "Shift+mousemove" or "mousemove" or "touchmove" (editing -> hover)
-   mouse is no longer over a point when "Shift+mousemove" or "mousemove" or "touchmove" (hover -> editing)
-   complete the polygon when "Right+mousedown" or "touchend" (drawing,placing -> editing)
-   delete the polygon and reset state when "Escape" (drawing,placing -> editing)
-   delete the polygon and reset state when "Escape" (editing -> ready)
